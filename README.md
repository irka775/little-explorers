# Little Explorers

Little Explorers is an e-commerce web application designed for customers looking to purchase high-quality children's clothing online.
ðŸš¨ **Disclaimer:** This is not a real store. The site is created for **learning purposes only** as part of a portfolio project.

This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing a full-featured online store with user authentication, product management, and secure payment integration.

Users can create accounts to manage their orders, while administrators have full write and delete access to all products and customer data.

You can also test the card payment functionality without making a real purchase. Use the following test card details:

**Card Number:** 4242 4242 4242 4242  
**Expiration Date:** Any future date  
**CVC:** Any 3-digit number  
**Postal Code:** Any 5-digit number

## Project Overview

Little Explorers is an assignment project created for learning purposes, designed as part of a portfolio in full-stack software development. While it is a fictional e-commerce store, the functionality is built to simulate a real-world online shopping experience.

This project focuses on **e-commerce development** using the **Django framework**, allowing users to browse children's clothing, add items to their cart, and complete purchases with a secure payment system.


### Agile Workflow

![Kanban Board](media\screenshots\canban_board.PNG)

For the development of **Little Explorers**, I have followed an **Agile approach**, breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks using **user stories**, a **Kanban board**, and **Labels** to track progress.

I have structured the workflow as follows:

- **User Stories:** Each feature or functionality is documented as a user story to ensure a user-centered design with an acceptance criteria.
- **Kanban Board:**  To manage the development of **Little Explorers**, I use an **Agile workflow** with a **Kanban board**, tracking progress across multiple stages.

- **To Do** â€“ Planned tasks and features.  
- **In Progress** â€“ Tasks currently being worked on.  
- **Done** â€“ Completed tasks.  

The **Kanban board** helps ensure a structured workflow and smooth progress from idea to implementation.
Tasks are managed visually, moving through stages: *To Do*, *In Progress*, and *Done*.
- **Labels:** labels suggest prioritization based on MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have).

The Kanban board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/irka775/projects/9/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=95547391&issue=irka775%7Clittle-explorers%7C25).

## User Experience

###  Strategy

#### **Primary Goals**

#### **The site owner's primary goals:**
- To provide an online store for selling children's clothing.
- To easily manage the store, including adding, removing, or editing products.
- To view and manage customer orders, with the ability to update or cancel them if necessary.
- To track customer information and order history for better service.
- To ensure the website is easy to navigate and fully responsive across all devices.
- To provide a customizable Admin Settings Panel for managing store preferences and user permissions.



#### **A potential customer's primary goals:**
- To browse and purchase high-quality children's clothing.
- To register for an account to track orders and manage their shopping experience.
- To view an order history and track past purchases.
- To edit personal account details or delete their account if desired.

#### **Developer goals**

As a student in the **Code Institute Full-Stack Software Development program**, I wanted to ensure that this project not only functions as a real-world e-commerce store but also follows best coding practices. While the primary focus of this site is to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers, I have also considered **developer-specific goals** to enhance maintainability, scalability, and performance.

These goals help ensure that the project is **efficiently built, secure, and ready for future improvements**.

##### **Key Developer Goals:**

#### Business Model

I have chosen a **traditional B2C (Business-to-Customer) e-commerce model**, where the store directly sells children's clothing to customers without intermediaries. The website is designed to provide a **straightforward and user-friendly shopping experience**, ensuring users(parents and guardians) can easily find and purchase high-quality clothing for their children.

Unlike marketplaces that host multiple sellers, **Little Explorers** operates as a **single-vendor store**, curating and offering products sourced from **reliable manufacturers and wholesalers**. 

#### **Business Flow**
-  Little Explorers sources children's clothing from trusted manufacturers and wholesalers.  
-  Products are listed on the website, categorized for easy browsing and filtering.  
-  Customers browse, add items to their cart, and purchase through a secure checkout system (powered by Stripe).  
-  Orders are processed and shipped directly to the customer.  
-  Customers can review their purchases, helping future buyers make informed decisions.  
-  Marketing Efforts: Newsletter Campaigns users can subscribe to receive exclusive discounts, new arrivals, and seasonal promotions via email.

#### **Revenue Model**
- Direct Sales: Customers purchase clothing directly from the store.
- Promotional Offers & Discounts: Special promotions encourage repeat purchases.
- Newsletter Marketing: Registered users can **subscribe to receive promotional emails**, ensuring they stay updated on new collections and deals.
#### **User Experience Focus**
The website is designed to be:
- Easy to navigate, ensuring users can quickly find what they need.
- Mobile-friendly, allowing users to shop conveniently on any device.
- Secure & Trustworthy, integrating **secure payment processing** and **customer reviews** to build confidence.

**Little Explorers' mission** is to provide a seamless shopping experience where users(parents) can find stylish, comfortable, and affordable clothing for their children in just a few clicks.

####  Marketing

##### **Marketing Strategy**
For the **Little Explorers** e-commerce project, I have developed a **basic Facebook marketing strategy** to simulate how a real business would promote an online store. However, since this project is created for learning purposes and is not a real e-commerce site, I have set up a **fictional Facebook page** and captured a screenshot of it instead of managing an actual social media presence.
 
This site has a Facebook Business page with a link on the page footer. **Screenshot of the Fictional Facebook Page:**

 ![Facebook Page Screenshot](media\facebook_bussines_page.PNG) 

While this page is only a placeholder for learning purposes, in the future, a fully functional Facebook page could be implemented with more advanced social media marketing strategies like:
- Regular product updates and promotions to engage potential customers.  
- Customer interaction via comments, messages, and reviews to build trust.  
- Facebook Ads campaigns to increase visibility and drive traffic to the store. 


##### **Newsletter Subscription (Email Marketing)**
**Little Explorers** integrates **Mailchimp** to allow users to subscribe to newsletters during registration. This simulates how an online store can engage with customers through **exclusive offers, product updates, and seasonal promotions**.

- Upon subscribing, users are get a confirmation message.  
- The site owner can track subscribers in the **Mailchimp Audience Dashboard**.  
- Subscribers receive promotional emails when new collections, discounts, or special events are launched.


#### **Subscription Form**
![Subscription Form](media\screenshots\subscribe_email.PNG)

#### **Subscription Confirmation Page**
![Subscription Confirmation Page](media\screenshots\subscribe.PNG)

#### **Subscription Success Message**
![Subscription Success Message](media\screenshots\unsubscribe.PNG)

### **Future Marketing Plans (If the Project Expands)**
If **Little Explorers** grows into a real business, the marketing strategy could include:
- **A fully developed and active Facebook page** with real promotions.  
- **Expansion to Instagram & Pinterest** for better product showcasing.  
- **Google Ads & SEO optimization** to attract organic traffic.  
- **Loyalty programs and referral discounts** to increase repeat customers.

#### Search Engine Optimisation

I have generated a sitemap.xml and robots.txt file which helps Google map the pages of the site.

I have also done some research on highest searched words in kids clothing retailing, and came up with this title and description:

#### **Meta-tags seo**
![Meta-tags seo](media\screenshots\meta_tags.PNG)

- **store_settings/** - Manages store-level **configuration settings, shipping settings, and admin control options**.
- **templates/** - Holds the **HTML templates** used for rendering pages. This includes:
  - **auth templates** (Django Allauth).
  - **error pages** (400, 403, 404, 500).
  - **base templates and layout files**.
- **manage.py** - The main Python script for running the Django project.

##### Database

- **Development Database**: [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is used for local testing.
- **Production Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is used for better scalability and is hosted via **Heroku**.
  Both are relational databases and work well with the Django framework used for this project.

 **Security & Environmental Variables**

Sensitive data such as **API keys, database credentials, and payment gateway secrets** are **never stored in the codebase** and instead of that I have been created:
- `env.py` for local development.
- **Heroku Config Vars** in Heroku platform for Heroku development.


##### Data Models

The **Little Explorers** e-commerce platform utilizes a relational database structure, following Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).The following models have been used to populate the database and for the site to function as it should:

 **1. User & Profiles**
The UserProfile model extends Djangoâ€™s built-in **User model**, storing **default shipping details** and **account preferences**. 
**User** - the built in Django User model, facilitates the users basic information.
**UserProfile** - the model storing the users product and order information. 

 **2. Products & Categories**
The Product model represents items available for sale, with categories and reviews linked to it.
**Category** - the category in which the product is place.
**Product** - the model for the product itself and its details.
**WishListItem** - the customer has the option to save an item, which will then appear in their wish list on the My StepUp page.

 **3. Reviews**
Customers can leave **product reviews** or **general site feedback**.
 **Review** - a model for users to give the product a rating and a review.

 **4. Shopping & Orders**
Orders contain **multiple line items**, and each product purchased is stored separately in **OrderLineItem**.
 **Order** - a users successful purchase leads to an instance of the Order model being created, storing delivery and user data.
 **OrderLineItem** - a model holding the product information for a single product, binding the product model together with the order.

 **5. Store Settings & Shipping**
Admin users manage store configurations, shipping options, and payment settings.

##### Schema of models

I used in **Little Explorers** e-commerce platform a **relational database structure** and below is a schema diagram representing the relationships between models.

 **Schema Diagram**
![Schema of models](--------)

 **Key Relationships & Explanation**

 **1. User & UserProfile**
- The UserProfile model extends Djangoâ€™s built-in User model.
- It stores default shipping details, helping users complete orders faster.
- **Relationship:** UserProfile has a OneToOneField with User.

**2. Products & Categories**
- A Product belongs to a Category, allowing easy organization.
- Each Product can have multiple Reviews from customers.
- **Relationship:** Product has a ForeignKey to Category.

 **3. Reviews**
- Users can leave product reviews or site feedback.
- Reviews include a **rating, comment, and creation date.
- **Relationship:** 
  - A Review is linked to both a User and a Product (if applicable).

 **4. Orders & OrderLineItems**
- When a customer places an Order, it contains multiple OrderLineItems.
- Each OrderLineItem stores product, quantity, and subtotal.
- **Relationships:**
  - Order has multiple OrderLineItems (OneToMany).
  - Each OrderLineItem is linked to a Product (ForeignKey).

 **5. Wishlist**
- Customers can save favorite products to their wishlist.
- **Relationships:**
  - Wishlist has a OneToOneField with User.
  - A Wishlist can contain multiple Products (ManyToMany).

 **6. Store Settings & Shipping**
- The StoreSettings model manages global store settings, branding, and payment options.
- ShippingSettings controls delivery costs and free shipping thresholds**.
- **Relationship:** ShippingSettings has a ForeignKey to StoreSettings.

 **7. Subscribers**
- Customers and guests can subscribe to the newsletter.
- **Relationships:**
  - A Subscriber can be linked to a User (OneToOne) or just an email.

This schema ensures that Little Explorers remains scalable, secure, and optimized for handling user interactions, product management, and orders.

-  **Blue (#3498DB)** â€“ Used for navigation elements, adding a cool and friendly tone to the design.
-  **Black (#000000)** â€“ Used for text and important contrast elements, ensuring readability.
-  **White (#FFFFFF)** â€“ Used for backgrounds and text, keeping the interface clean and modern.

##### **Accent Colors**
-  **Orange (#F39C12)** â€“ Used for small highlights or action elements, adding warmth and contrast.
-  **Red (#E74C3C)** â€“ Used for important actions, such as the unsubscribe button.

##### **Text Colors**
- The main text color is **black (#000000)**, ensuring strong readability on light backgrounds.
- Some elements use **white text (#FFFFFF)** when displayed on dark or colorful backgrounds for better contrast.
- In the future, I may experiment with **softer shades** to enhance the reading experience, especially for longer texts.

##### **Design Inspiration**
The color scheme was chosen to create a fun, fresh, and engaging experience for customers browsing children's clothing. The combination of green and blue reflects playfulness and comfort, while the black and white elements ensure easy readability and a modern aesthetic.

##### **Future Improvements**
As a student, I am aware that the current color palette could be further optimized for better usability, branding, and accessibility. When I decide to extend and scale this project, I will experiment with alternative color schemes to improve contrast and readability and ensure that colors meet accessibility standards for visually impaired users.




#### Design Choices


The Little Explorers website I was designed with a playful yet clean aesthetic, incorporating soft transitions, rounded edges, and engaging colors to create a welcoming experience for users browsing children's clothing.

**Navbar & Header**
The navbar is designed to be highly functional and visually appealing, maintaining a fixed position at the top of the page for easy navigation. The background features a gradient green-blue blend, making the site feel vibrant and lively.

- The navbar includes icons for user accounts, cart, and categories, ensuring quick access to important sections.
- A search bar allows users to find products efficiently.
- The header features a full-screen hero image with an inviting message and a call-to-action button for exploring products.

![Navbar](media\screenshots\navbar.PNG)


 **Buttons & UI Elements**
Buttons across the site are designed to be eye-catching and functional, enhancing usability and user engagement.

- Primary buttons use a linear-gradient CSS effect to create a glossy finish.
- The "Discover More" button on the homepage stands out with a bold black background for contrast.
- Admin-related buttons (e.g., for managing products) are styled differently to clearly distinguish them from user-facing elements.
- The Unsubscribe button is colored red, indicating a critical action.
- The Subscribe" button is styled in a green color, representing a positive action for users who want to stay updated.
  Below are some screenshots showcasing the design choices implemented throughout the website:
 ![Button Elements](media\screenshots\button1.PNG)
 ![Button Elements](media\screenshots\button2.PNG)

 **Typography & Readability**
- The site primarily uses black text  for readability.
- White text is used on dark backgrounds to maintain contrast.
- Fonts are chosen for a modern and clean look, ensuring that product descriptions and labels are easy to read.

 **For future Improvements**
 - I recognize that design choices can always be improved. In the future, I plan to refine the color contrast for better accessibility and implement a dynamic navbar that fades or adjusts upon scrolling and thinking to enhance button styles for even better user engagement.

#### Typography

The typography on Little Explorers I was carefully chosen to ensure clarity, readability, and a modern,simple feel . The primary font used across the website is Lato (Google Font), with Helvetica Neue as a fallback for consistency and Comic Sans MS (Used in the Banner), applied to the announcement banner for a fun and playful touch.

 **Font Usage Across the Homepage**
- **Navigation Bar & Menu** â†’ *Lato (Google Font)*
- **Banner** â†’ *Comic Sans MS', 'Arial', sans-serif;* (Google Font)*
- **Main Heading ("Welcome to our store")** â†’ *Lato (Bold variant)*
- **Body Text & Buttons (Discover More, Unsubscribe, etc.)** â†’ *Lato (Regular & Semi-Bold)*
- **Fallback Font for Safety** â†’ *Helvetica Neue*

### Acknowledgments

Throughout the development of Little Explorers, I received incredible support, guidance, and inspiration from various people. I would like to take a moment to express my gratitude to first : to my husband,for his unwavering support and encouragement throughout this journey. His motivation and belief in me kept me going even during the toughest moments. Secondly to Laura_ci(cohort facilitator) for inspiring me and providing valuable guidance on how to structure a clear and professional README documentation. Her advice has been instrumental in helping me create a well-organized and informative project. I would also like to extend my gratitude to all the Tutors at Code Institute for their patience and support. Thank you for your guidance, patience, and invaluable support throughout this journey. The development of Little Explorers has been a challenging yet rewarding experience. The support, guidance, and resources mentioned above played a crucial role in making this project successful.
