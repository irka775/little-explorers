# Little Explorers

Little Explorers is an e-commerce web application designed for customers looking to purchase high-quality children's clothing online.
ðŸš¨ **Disclaimer:** This is not a real store. The site is created for **learning purposes only** as part of a portfolio project.

This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing a full-featured online store with user authentication, product management, and secure payment integration.

Users can create accounts to manage their orders, while administrators have full write and delete access to all products and customer data.

You can also test the card payment functionality without making a real purchase. Use the following test card details:

**Card Number:** 4242 4242 4242 4242  
**Expiration Date:** Any future date  
**CVC:** Any 3-digit number  
**Postal Code:** Any 5-digit number

## Project Overview

Little Explorers is an assignment project created for learning purposes, designed as part of a portfolio in full-stack software development. While it is a fictional e-commerce store, the functionality is built to simulate a real-world online shopping experience.

This project focuses on **e-commerce development** using the **Django framework**, allowing users to browse children's clothing, add items to their cart, and complete purchases with a secure payment system.


### Agile Workflow

![Kanban Board](media\screenshots\canban_board.PNG)

For the development of **Little Explorers**, I have followed an **Agile approach**, breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks using **user stories**, a **Kanban board**, and **Labels** to track progress.

I have structured the workflow as follows:

- **User Stories:** Each feature or functionality is documented as a user story to ensure a user-centered design with an acceptance criteria.
- **Kanban Board:**  To manage the development of **Little Explorers**, I use an **Agile workflow** with a **Kanban board**, tracking progress across multiple stages.

- **To Do** â€“ Planned tasks and features.  
- **In Progress** â€“ Tasks currently being worked on.  
- **Done** â€“ Completed tasks.  

The **Kanban board** helps ensure a structured workflow and smooth progress from idea to implementation.
Tasks are managed visually, moving through stages: *To Do*, *In Progress*, and *Done*.
- **Labels:** labels suggest prioritization based on MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have).

The Kanban board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/irka775/projects/9/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=95547391&issue=irka775%7Clittle-explorers%7C25).

## User Experience

###  Strategy

#### **Primary Goals**

#### **The site owner's primary goals:**
- To provide an online store for selling children's clothing.
- To easily manage the store, including adding, removing, or editing products.
- To view and manage customer orders, with the ability to update or cancel them if necessary.
- To track customer information and order history for better service.
- To ensure the website is easy to navigate and fully responsive across all devices.
- To provide a customizable Admin Settings Panel for managing store preferences and user permissions.



#### **A potential customer's primary goals:**
- To browse and purchase high-quality children's clothing.
- To register for an account to track orders and manage their shopping experience.
- To view an order history and track past purchases.
- To edit personal account details or delete their account if desired.

#### **Developer goals**

As a student in the **Code Institute Full-Stack Software Development program**, I wanted to ensure that this project not only functions as a real-world e-commerce store but also follows best coding practices. While the primary focus of this site is to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers, I have also considered **developer-specific goals** to enhance maintainability, scalability, and performance.

These goals help ensure that the project is **efficiently built, secure, and ready for future improvements**.

##### **Key Developer Goals:**

#### Business Model

I have chosen a **traditional B2C (Business-to-Customer) e-commerce model**, where the store directly sells children's clothing to customers without intermediaries. The website is designed to provide a **straightforward and user-friendly shopping experience**, ensuring users(parents and guardians) can easily find and purchase high-quality clothing for their children.

Unlike marketplaces that host multiple sellers, **Little Explorers** operates as a **single-vendor store**, curating and offering products sourced from **reliable manufacturers and wholesalers**. 

#### **Business Flow**
-  Little Explorers sources children's clothing from trusted manufacturers and wholesalers.  
-  Products are listed on the website, categorized for easy browsing and filtering.  
-  Customers browse, add items to their cart, and purchase through a secure checkout system (powered by Stripe).  
-  Orders are processed and shipped directly to the customer.  
-  Customers can review their purchases, helping future buyers make informed decisions.  
-  Marketing Efforts: Newsletter Campaigns users can subscribe to receive exclusive discounts, new arrivals, and seasonal promotions via email.

#### **Revenue Model**
- Direct Sales: Customers purchase clothing directly from the store.
- Promotional Offers & Discounts: Special promotions encourage repeat purchases.
- Newsletter Marketing: Registered users can **subscribe to receive promotional emails**, ensuring they stay updated on new collections and deals.
#### **User Experience Focus**
The website is designed to be:
- Easy to navigate, ensuring users can quickly find what they need.
- Mobile-friendly, allowing users to shop conveniently on any device.
- Secure & Trustworthy, integrating **secure payment processing** and **customer reviews** to build confidence.

**Little Explorers' mission** is to provide a seamless shopping experience where users(parents) can find stylish, comfortable, and affordable clothing for their children in just a few clicks.

####  Marketing

##### **Marketing Strategy**
For the **Little Explorers** e-commerce project, I have developed a **basic Facebook marketing strategy** to simulate how a real business would promote an online store. However, since this project is created for learning purposes and is not a real e-commerce site, I have set up a **fictional Facebook page** and captured a screenshot of it instead of managing an actual social media presence.
 
This site has a Facebook Business page with a link on the page footer. **Screenshot of the Fictional Facebook Page:**

 ![Facebook Page Screenshot](media\facebook_bussines_page.PNG) 

While this page is only a placeholder for learning purposes, in the future, a fully functional Facebook page could be implemented with more advanced social media marketing strategies like:
- Regular product updates and promotions to engage potential customers.  
- Customer interaction via comments, messages, and reviews to build trust.  
- Facebook Ads campaigns to increase visibility and drive traffic to the store. 


##### **Newsletter Subscription (Email Marketing)**
**Little Explorers** integrates **Mailchimp** to allow users to subscribe to newsletters during registration. This simulates how an online store can engage with customers through **exclusive offers, product updates, and seasonal promotions**.

- Upon subscribing, users are get a confirmation message.  
- The site owner can track subscribers in the **Mailchimp Audience Dashboard**.  
- Subscribers receive promotional emails when new collections, discounts, or special events are launched.


#### **Subscription Form**
![Subscription Form](media\screenshots\subscribe_email.PNG)

#### **Subscription Confirmation Page**
![Subscription Confirmation Page](media\screenshots\subscribe.PNG)

#### **Subscription Success Message**
![Subscription Success Message](media\screenshots\unsubscribe.PNG)

### **Future Marketing Plans (If the Project Expands)**
If **Little Explorers** grows into a real business, the marketing strategy could include:
- **A fully developed and active Facebook page** with real promotions.  
- **Expansion to Instagram & Pinterest** for better product showcasing.  
- **Google Ads & SEO optimization** to attract organic traffic.  
- **Loyalty programs and referral discounts** to increase repeat customers.

#### Search Engine Optimisation

I have generated a sitemap.xml and robots.txt file which helps Google map the pages of the site.

I have also done some research on highest searched words in kids clothing retailing, and came up with this title and description:

#### **Meta-tags seo**
![Meta-tags seo](media\screenshots\meta_tags.PNG)

**Other Directories and Files**

- **static/** - Contains **CSS, JavaScript, and frontend assets** used for styling and interactivity.
- **media/** - Stores **uploaded product images** for local development (in production, these are stored externally).
- **store_settings/** - Manages store-level **configuration settings, shipping settings, and admin control options**.
- **templates/** - Holds the **HTML templates** used for rendering pages. This includes:
  - **auth templates** (Django Allauth).
  - **error pages** (400, 403, 404, 500).
  - **base templates and layout files**.
- **manage.py** - The main Python script for running the Django project.
- **custom_storages.py** - Configures **AWS S3 for static and media file storage**.

##### Database

- **Development Database**: [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is used for local testing.
- **Production Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is used for better scalability and is hosted via **Heroku**.
  Both are relational databases and work well with the Django framework used for this project.

 **Security & Environmental Variables**

Sensitive data such as **API keys, database credentials, and payment gateway secrets** are **never stored in the codebase** and instead of that I have been created:
- `env.py` for local development.
- **Heroku Config Vars** in Heroku platform for Heroku development.


##### Data Models

The **Little Explorers** e-commerce platform utilizes a relational database structure, following Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).The following models have been used to populate the database and for the site to function as it should:

 **1. User & Profiles**
The UserProfile model extends Djangoâ€™s built-in **User model**, storing **default shipping details** and **account preferences**. 
**User** - the built in Django User model, facilitates the users basic information.
**UserProfile** - the model storing the users product and order information. 

 **2. Products & Categories**
The Product model represents items available for sale, with categories and reviews linked to it.
**Category** - the category in which the product is place.
**Product** - the model for the product itself and its details.
**WishListItem** - the customer has the option to save an item, which will then appear in their wish list on the My StepUp page.

 **3. Reviews**
Customers can leave **product reviews** or **general site feedback**.
 **Review** - a model for users to give the product a rating and a review.

 **4. Shopping & Orders**
Orders contain **multiple line items**, and each product purchased is stored separately in **OrderLineItem**.
 **Order** - a users successful purchase leads to an instance of the Order model being created, storing delivery and user data.
 **OrderLineItem** - a model holding the product information for a single product, binding the product model together with the order.

 **5. Store Settings & Shipping**
Admin users manage store configurations, shipping options, and payment settings.

##### Schema of models

I used in **Little Explorers** e-commerce platform a **relational database structure** and below is a schema diagram representing the relationships between models.

 **Schema Diagram**
![Schema of models](--------)

 **Key Relationships & Explanation**

 **1. User & UserProfile**
- The UserProfile model extends Djangoâ€™s built-in User model.
- It stores default shipping details, helping users complete orders faster.
- **Relationship:** UserProfile has a OneToOneField with User.

**2. Products & Categories**
- A Product belongs to a Category, allowing easy organization.
- Each Product can have multiple Reviews from customers.
- **Relationship:** Product has a ForeignKey to Category.

 **3. Reviews**
- Users can leave product reviews or site feedback.
- Reviews include a **rating, comment, and creation date.
- **Relationship:** 
  - A Review is linked to both a User and a Product (if applicable).

 **4. Orders & OrderLineItems**
- When a customer places an Order, it contains multiple OrderLineItems.
- Each OrderLineItem stores product, quantity, and subtotal.
- **Relationships:**
  - Order has multiple OrderLineItems (OneToMany).
  - Each OrderLineItem is linked to a Product (ForeignKey).

 **5. Wishlist**
- Customers can save favorite products to their wishlist.
- **Relationships:**
  - Wishlist has a OneToOneField with User.
  - A Wishlist can contain multiple Products (ManyToMany).

 **6. Store Settings & Shipping**
- The StoreSettings model manages global store settings, branding, and payment options.
- ShippingSettings controls delivery costs and free shipping thresholds**.
- **Relationship:** ShippingSettings has a ForeignKey to StoreSettings.

 **7. Subscribers**
- Customers and guests can subscribe to the newsletter.
- **Relationships:**
  - A Subscriber can be linked to a User (OneToOne) or just an email.

This schema ensures that Little Explorers remains scalable, secure, and optimized for handling user interactions, product management, and orders.

Wireframe images were made for all pages except for the ones rarely used by the site, for example password change and email confirmation.

All wireframes can be viewed [here](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah/blob/main/docs/wireframes/WIREFRAMES.md)

### Surface

#### Colors

![Colors](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah/blob/main/docs/surface/colors.png) (palette generated at https://imagecolorpicker.com)

I have chosen the combination of a dark purple night sky as the background, orange and white for text and main buttons in orange and grey. As design is important to me, I couldn't help myself in experimenting and exploring in the possibilities for this project.

#### Design Choices

I have added lots of semi-transparent elements to create a feeling of three-dimentionality, for example the navbar. It fades to completely transparent on scroll, so users can view the content in full.

## ![Navbar](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah/blob/main/docs/surface/gif_navbar_scroll.png)

Buttons are coloured with CSS-style attribute background: linear-gradient to create a glossy finish on the main buttons.
Admin operation buttons on products and brands are styled differently to distinguish them from the others.

Here you can see some of the button elements, as well as the badge, here used to indicate that the product is on sale.

## ![Button Elements](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah/blob/main/docs/surface/button_badge_elements.png)

#### Typography

Google Fonts was used for all fonts on this site, and I have used three fonts:

- Anaheim for the general content, but also the main heading
  ![Anaheim Font](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah/blob/main/docs/surface/font_anaheim.png)

---

- Average for the hero images
  ![Anaheim Font](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah/blob/main/docs/surface/font_average.png)

---

- Abel for the page headings and main products nav menu

I think they blend well together with the main Anaheim Logo:

## Existing Features

### Feature 1: The Navbar

The navbar allows users to easily navigate the website, no matter which page they are on. The navbar consists of:

- The products navigation menu, with sorting or filtering possibilities
- A search bar, displaying results based on product name
- A Sign In/Sign Up icon
- Cart

**Products Nav Desktop**

## ![Home Desktop Products nav](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah/blob/main/docs/testing/screenshots/user_case_1/desktop_prod_nav.png)

The navbar is also dynamic, transparent when users scroll down, for full content visibility, and turns a translucent blue shade when scrolling up, so menu items are visible.

If the user us logged in, the Sign Up/Sign In menu becomes the Account menu, and if the user has admin privileges the user can access the manage brands an add product or brand pages through here.

There is a floating badge in the top right corner displaying the grand total and item count, always visible of the user scrolls up, which also gets an orange border if items are added.

## Features Yet to Implement

User story 30, adding products to the cart, is a could have user story, and for this implementation I decided not to include in production. This due to the need for quantity and size input from user, and there was no space on the My StepUp page in the current design for this.

Also, the ability for site owners to keep track of stock numbers is an important future update.

Having several images for the products is intended, but, as this is a fictional site and the images are royalty free, I had to make do with the single image for each one. In a real world scenario, the site owner would provide me with all content for the site, erasing this issue.

- [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) was used to create wireframe images of the website which you can view [here](#).

- [Lucidchart](https://lucid.co/product/lucidchart) was used to create the visual [model schema](#schema-of-models) of the project.

## Testing

Thorough testing of the StepUp site was performed and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah/blob/main/docs/testing/TESTING.md).

## Other Services

### Stripe

Stripe was used as a payment service, allowing users to pay for products. The process:

1. Create an account at https://stripe.com/
2. Go to the developers pane and navigate to API keys
3. Copy the publishable and secret keys and put them in your config vars in your development envirenment (and in Heroku config vars in production)

Webhooks were created too to make sure payments did not fail due to web errors. This can be done by doing the following:

1. Navigate to Webhooks on the page, and create an endpoint with the url you send your webhooks to, in this case, the url is https://stepup-shoes.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/
2. Add events to listen for, for example payment_intent_succeeded and payment_intent.payment_failed as in this case
3. The webhooks should be sent when processing orders in all cases

## Deployment

### Forking the GitHub Repository

To make a clone, or 'Fork' this repository, follow the steps below.

1. Access your GitHub account and find the relevant repository.
2. Click on 'Fork' on the top right of the page.
3. You will find a copy of the repository in your own Github account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Access your GitHub account and find the relevant repository.
2. Click the 'Code' button next to 'Add file'.
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under clone with HTTPS, copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Access the directory you want the clone to be have.
6. In your IDE's terminal type 'git clone' and the paste the URL you copied.
7. Press Enter.
8. You now have a local clone.

### Heroku

This application has been deployed from Github using Heroku. Here's how:

1. Create an account at [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/)
2. Create a new app, add app name and your region
3. Click on create app
4. Go to "Settings"
5. Under Config Vars, add your sensitive data (creds.json for example)
6. For this project, I set buildpacks to <Python> and <NodeJS> in that order.
7. Go to "Deploy" and at "Deployment method", click on "Connect to Github"
8. Enter your repository name and click on it when it shows below
9. Choose the branch you want to buid your app from
10. If desired, click on "Enable Automatic Deploys", which keeps the app up to date with your Github repository
11. All done!

### AWS S3

The deployed version of this website has static(CSS and JavaScript) and media files hosted to it via a web based service called Amazon Web Services S3 Bucket.

The steps to take are:

1. Create an account at aws.amazon.com
2. Navigate to the IAM application and create a user and group
3. Set the AmazonS3FullAccess for the user and copy the AWS ACCESS and SECRET keys as config vars to your workspace and deployment environment
4. Create a new Bucket within the S3 application with an appropriate name.
5. Enable public access for your bucket so users can access and use the services on your website (upload, view, download, etc). More info can be read in the official documentation: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/

## Performance

Performance was tested using Google Chrome's Lighthouse tool in DevTools built into the browser. The performance tests can be viewed [here](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah/blob/main/docs/performance/PERFORMANCE.md).

## Validation

Thourough validation of all code was made without errors. The results can be viewed [here](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah/blob/main/docs/validation/VALIDATION.md).

## Accessibility

Accessibility tests were also performed with the [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool and passed all tests. They can be viewed [here](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah/blob/main/docs/accessibility/ACCESSIBILITY.md).

## Bugs

Here are a few of the bugs found during the testing phase.

**Bug** - The forms in the Manage Brands page were displaying information for the wrong brand instances
_Fix_ - Remove the sorting functionality in the pages Django view which sorted the instances of brands but not the forms

**Bug** - Duplicate ID's in HTML elements due to Django creating the same form over again in Manage Brands
_Fix_ - Give a prefix of the brands ID to the form, ensuring each one is unique

**Bug** - Sizes displaying as 'N/A' even though product has size on Order Confirmation page
_Fix_ - Logic in order confirmation had false values, updated and works

**Bug** - When sent a password through the Django Allauth service, the link sent is http and not https. A warning by stripe in the terminal that payments for production only works with https is issued. This doesn't affect this site as the payments are for testing purposes, but needs to be investigated further in the future
_Fix_ - No fix as of now

**Bug** - Price validation in product form failing
_Fix_ - Creating variables in the JavaScript file that controls this, as the id's for the form are different on the edit and add pages where the form is present

**Bug** - Navbar animation jumpy and not displaying menus correctly at all times
_Fix_ - Refine JavaScript to add and remove classes to show and hide all elements of the nav upon clicking and accessing other menus, remove animations

**Bug** - Modal not displaying for remove review, only overlay
_Fix_ - Remove css attribute backdrop filter for modal causing issues

**Bug** - 404 error at checkout when processing payment
_Fix_ - Fix try and except in code that removes users wishlist items that are purchased
