"""
Django signal handlers for store settings and user subscriptions.

This module listens for Django model events such as:
- `post_save`: Triggered after a model instance is saved.
- `pre_save`: Triggered before a model instance is saved.
- `post_delete`: Triggered after a model instance is deleted.
- `post_migrate`: Triggered after migrations are applied.

These signals help in:
- Automatically updating Stripe currency settings.
- Logging creation, updates, and deletions of `StoreSettings`.
- Creating a `Subscriber` when a new `User` is registered.
