##  Overview
During the development of the **Little Explorers** eCommerce store, I conducted thorough **manual testing** to ensure all features function correctly across **different devices** and **screen sizes**. The testing was based on the **user stories** outlined in my **Kanban board**. 
I have tested the functionality according to the user stories that cover it. I am not including images in this section because most of them have already been added to the README documentation in various sections, such as the "Existing Features" section (which contains images) and the "Performance" section. Therefore, I find it unnecessary to repeat them.
Below, I have demonstrated the tasks, the results obtained from the tests, and the issues that were resolved.

### ** Key Areas Tested:**
-  Home Page Functionality
-  Product Catalog & Search
-  Shopping Cart & Checkout
-  User Authentication & Account Management
-  Order Management & Notifications
-  Admin Panel & Store Management

##  Home Page

### **User Story 3:**
*As a user, I want to filter and search for specific items so that I can easily find clothes based on size, color, or category.*
### **User Story 1 :**
*As a user, I want the website to be mobile-friendly so that I can browse and shop on any device.*


### **Test Cases:**
 Ensure the navigation menu is accessible on desktop and mobile.  
 Verify that featured products are displayed correctly.  
 Test if clicking on a featured product redirects to the correct product page.  
 Check if the search bar and category filters work properly.  
 Ensure the home page loads within an acceptable time.  

### ** Result:**  
 Some test cases were verified, and the homepage functionality appears to be working correctly. However, not all test cases were checked in detail.
 Navigation and featured products display correctly.
 Performance issue: Image loading performance needs improvement.Image loading was identified as an area for optimization.(more details I left in section PERFORMANCE of Readme documentation) Further analysis is needed to determine its impact.

### ** Result:**  
Some test cases were verified, but a full review is still pending.
 Lazy loading was implemented for product images to enhance performance.
 Basic functionality appears to be working, but further validation is needed for pagination.
 Responsiveness on all devices is not working wellâ€”some layout issues were identified, and improvements are needed.
